# Active Directory Security Assessment Tool

A comprehensive web-based tool for conducting security assessments of Active Directory environments. This tool helps security professionals and system administrators evaluate their AD infrastructure against security best practices and Microsoft Security Configuration Toolkit standards.

## Key Features
- üîí Secure web-based interface for AD security assessment
- üîë Role-based access control with password protection
- üìä Detailed assessment reports and recommendations
- ‚öôÔ∏è Highly configurable assessment parameters
- üîÑ Mock mode for testing and development
- üìù Comprehensive logging and audit trails

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14.x or higher
- Windows environment (for AD integration)
- Network access to domain controllers (for production use)

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manabouprj/ad-security-assessment.git
cd ad-security-assessment

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure the application
cp config.example.json config.json
```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `config.json` with your environment settings:
```json
{
  "domain": "your-domain.com",
  "server": "dc.your-domain.com",
  "username": "service-account",
  "password": "",
  "mock_mode": true,  # Set to false for production
  "output_dir": "reports",
  "verbose": true
}
```

### 3. Starting the Application

```bash
# Start the Flask backend server
python api_server.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000

### 4. First-Time Setup

1. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000
2. Default username: "Orunmila"
3. Create a secure password on first login that meets these requirements:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - At least 2 uppercase letters
   - At least 3 lowercase letters
   - At least 2 numbers
   - At least 1 special character

### 5. Running Assessments

1. Log in to the web interface
2. Configure assessment parameters:
   - Target domain controllers
   - Assessment scope
   - Security baseline selection
3. Click "Start Assessment" to begin
4. View real-time results and generate reports

## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Change the default username and password
- Enable HTTPS using a valid SSL certificate
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Use a production-grade WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
- Set up proper backup procedures for assessment data

### Access Control
- Use service accounts with minimum required permissions
- Enable audit logging
- Regularly rotate passwords
- Monitor access logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify network connectivity to domain controllers
   - Check service account permissions
   - Ensure proper DNS resolution

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify service account credentials
   - Check for password expiration
   - Ensure proper group memberships

3. **Assessment Failures**
   - Check network timeouts
   - Verify access permissions
   - Review error logs in the `logs` directory

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, enable debug mode:
```bash
python api_server.py --debug
```

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with mock mode
python api_server.py --mock
```
