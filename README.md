## Key Features
- üîí Secure web-based interface for AD security assessment
- üîë Role-based access control with password protection
- üìä Detailed assessment reports and recommendations
- ‚öôÔ∏è Highly configurable assessment parameters
- üîÑ Mock mode for testing and development
- üìù Comprehensive logging and audit trails

## Quick Start

For detailed setup and running instructions, please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Basic Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manabouprj/ad-security-assessment.git
cd ad-security-assessment

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows PowerShell

# Install package and dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .

# Set up package structure
python setup_package.py

# Configure the application
copy config.example.json config.json
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the API server (recommended method)
python run_api.py
```

Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

Default credentials:
- Username: "Orunmila"
- You'll be prompted to create a secure password on first login

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows environment (for AD integration)
- Network access to domain controllers (for production use)
- Local administrator rights (for installation)

## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Change the default username and password
- Enable HTTPS using a valid SSL certificate
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Use a production-grade WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
- Set up proper backup procedures for assessment data

### Access Control
- Use service accounts with minimum required permissions
- Enable audit logging
- Regularly rotate passwords
- Monitor access logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify network connectivity to domain controllers
   - Check service account permissions
   - Ensure proper DNS resolution

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify service account credentials
   - Check for password expiration
   - Ensure proper group memberships

3. **Assessment Failures**
   - Check network timeouts
   - Verify access permissions
   - Review error logs in the `logs` directory

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, enable debug mode:
```bash
python api_server.py --debug
```

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with mock mode
python api_server.py --mock
```
